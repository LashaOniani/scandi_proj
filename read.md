well, before i start the project...

I only know procedurial PHP and I will try my best
to finish this project and lend the job on Scandi.

the next few steps will be:

1) I will start learning OOP principles;
2) With the help of ChatOpenAI I will try to understand the project requirements;
3) me and chat we will try to write the code;
4) after that I will try to write the code;

down below there will be a little history how I started building the project:

1. I downloaded xampp, honastly I had :D;
2. I created Folder scandi_store;
3. Inside the folder I created a little form to test if everyhing was working correctly (I createed productAdd html and php);
4. firstly, when I started building the project I didn't know what was SKU
    so the sku is like uniqe identifire for each product. we have 3 types of product 
        1. DVD disc - JVC200123;
        2. Book - GGWP0007;
        3. Furniture - TR120555;
    and pretty much every product has name, price and sku;
    so we should have a product class and this class should extend different classes like: DVD, Book, Furniture, because 
    each product has different One of the product-specific attributes and its value like: Size, Weight, Dimensions;
    -- so this will be my first task --
    first task:
    so for the first task I started learning oop from w3 school and it really was kinda long way
    after that i tried to create some different classes and honastly had a hard time when I went to Inheritance
    -- why?
    -- because when I made class Car and it had 3 poperty like name model and year also I made child class Mercedes
    -- that had another property and it was tuneCompany and when i started building contruct function it was keep crashing
    -- after 2 hours of debuging i found that i named construct consturuct and that was the reason it's not working
    after this I started building firstly Product class
